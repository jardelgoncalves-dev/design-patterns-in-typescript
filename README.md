Design patterns implementations in TypeScript

### Creational
Creational patterns are ones that create objects for you, rather than having you instantiate objects directly.
- **[Builder](src/creational/builder/)**: separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. By doing so the same construction process can create different representations.
- **[Abstract Factory](src/creational/abstract_factory/)**: provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **[Factory Method](src/creational/factory_method/)**: defines an interface to create an object, but it allows the subclasses to decide that instance class.
