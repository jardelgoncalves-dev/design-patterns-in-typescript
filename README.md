# Design patterns in TypeScript
Design patterns implementations in TypeScript

### Creational
Creational patterns are ones that create objects for you, rather than having you instantiate objects directly.
- **[Abstract Factory](src/creational/abstract_factory/)**: provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- **[Factory Method](src/creational/factory_method/)**: defines an interface to create an object, but it allows the subclasses to decide that instance class.
